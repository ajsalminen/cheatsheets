You can do git add -p filename.x, and it'll ask you what you want to stage. You can then:

hit s to split whatever change into smaller hunks. This only works if there is at least one unchanged line in the "middle" of the hunk, which is where the hunk will be split
then hit either:
y to stage that hunk, or
n to not stage that hunk, or
e to manually edit the hunk (useful when git can't split it automatically)
and d to exit or go to the next file.
Use ? to get the whole list of available options.
If the file is not in the repository yet, do first git add -N filename.x. Afterwards you can go on with git add -p filename.x.
