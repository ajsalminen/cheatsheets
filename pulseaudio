# Answer from http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10739390/how-to-programmatically-change-volume-in-ubuntu
Ubuntu uses pulseaudio as sounderver. It can be controlled from the command line using the pactl and pacmd utilities, for example:
pactl set-sink-volume 0 120%
would set the volume of the sink #0 to 120%.
see: man pactl and pacmd help
edit:
to avoid -xx being interpreted as command line option you must prefix it with -- . That stops option parsing from that point:
pactl set-sink-volume 0 -- -20%    # or:
pactl -- set-sink-volume 0 -20%    # doesn't matter where the `--` goes
