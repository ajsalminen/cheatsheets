# To copy files from remote to local, maintaining file properties and sym-links (-a), zipping for faster transfer (-z), verbose (-v).
rsync -avz host:file1 :file1 /dest/
rsync -avz /source host:/dest

# Copy files using checksum (-c) rather than time to detect if the file has changed. (Useful for validating backups).
rsync -avc /source/ /dest/

# Copy contents of /src/foo to destination:

# This command will create /dest/foo if it does not already exist
rsync -auv /src/foo /dest

# Explicitly copy /src/foo to /dest/foo
rsync -auv /src/foo/ /dest/foo

# Custom additions:
# Resume a partial file that was copied with eg. scp
rsync --append --progress sourcefile host.example.com:destfile

# TL;DR for some options:
# also see http://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/2445/resume-transfer-of-a-single-file-by-rsync
# --partial leave partials and resume (but only by rsync, because temp file used)
# --append implies inplace, shorter file seen as partial, not verified
# --append-verify also checksum verification for whole file
# --inplace do not use a temp file (crucial for resuming downloads by other apps)
